**Big Text** allows you to quickly transform text into UTF compatible, multi-line, big "ASCII-like" text.
This is useful for headers, header comments and other related needs.

----------

It simply comes with one command, `bigtext`, which transforms your marked text into big multi-line text.

It has no associated keybind.  
Either call it from VSCodes' `Show All Commands` (default: *Ctrl+Shift+P*), or associate a keyboard shortcut.

To use it, mark some text, then call the command.
It will remove your selected text and replace it with two new lines of *beautiful* multi-line text.

**It will ignore any other non-letter characters, including line feeds!**

Examples below.  
**Enjoy!**
